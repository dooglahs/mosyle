# Mosyle Scripts, Tips, and Tricks

I've recently started working with Mosyle, but Mosyle's own documentation is scant (even if their support is phenomenal) and the community is relatively small. This is my attempt to make it a little less small.

I am currently using Mosyle's Business instance, though these should work just as well for the Education instances.

## Scripts

* Default Userspace Settings. Allows you to set default settings for the user where a profile might work, but you want to allow the user to later change the settings. Setting the Desktop Picture is an example.
* DEP Default Userspace Settings. Same as the above but works via the DEP process with limitations. See the header in the script for more information.
* ZoomIT Plist Installer. Zoom has an IT installer, and provides an example plist of the settings you can set. This script deploys your customized plist and versions the plist so older versions can be updated over time.

## Tips

None at this time except to join the MacAdmin's Slack channel!

## Tricks

None at this time, though I intend to describe how I use device groups with criteria eventually.
